        # 2. "Load first" attempts to satisfy the load, including power
        # 3. Many batteries discharge more efficiently at higher discharge powers
        # 4. ÂµWRs try to balance their inputs to equal power

        # batteries start their day in load_first @ 800W
        # once full, they switch to "battery first"
        # if not enough solar power is available anymore (for a defined interval), we switch 1 battery back to "load_first" @ 800W untils its empty (to maximize discharge efficiency) and switch it back to "load_first" @ 800W (new cycle)
        # once that battery is depleted, we switch the next one back to "load_first" @ 800W
        # at sunrise, we switch all batteries back to "load_first" @ 800W (new cycle)

        # so in each iteration we check if a battery is above is full (based on the threshold). If so we switch it to battery first.
        # we limit the amount of switches to n_switch_per_day to avoid ping-ponging
